<h3>Insurance</h3>

<p>Plan Your Recovery does not contract with insurance companies for direct payment, but we will submit your group, individual, and family therapy sessions to insurance as a courtesy. Reimbursement will depend on your out-of-network benefits and your insurer's service requirements. Reimbursement is not guaranteed.</p>
