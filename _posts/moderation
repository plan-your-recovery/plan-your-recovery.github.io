<p><em>The idea that somehow, someday he will control and enjoy his drinking is the great obsession of every abnormal drinker. The persistence of this illusion is astonishing. Many pursue it into the gates of insanity or death. (Big Book, Chapter 3)</em></p>
<p>The founders of AA suggest that attempts at moderation provide the best litmus test for alcoholism. Heavy drinkers that are able to cut back without abstaining are not alcoholics because they haven't become powerless over alcohol.</p>
<p>Heavy drinkers that are able to moderate their drinking may be more like persons with per-hypertension or pre-diabetes. They are vulnerable to developing the illness, but they seem to have caught the symptoms early enough to prevent that development.</p>
<p>Among the 1% of persons who receive treatment for an alcohol use disorder each year, there are probably very few persons with pre-alcoholism. But among the 6% of Americans who need but don't receive treatment or the 11% who did not need or receive treatment but say they wanted or tried to cut back on their drinking, there are probably quite a few persons with pre-alcoholism. In fact, <em>30% of all Americans who drank alcohol in the past year either demonstrated a need for treatment or said that they wanted or tried to reduce or stop their drinking. </em>It's a safe bet that not all of these 45 million Americans suffer from full blown alcoholism (<a href="http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NAHDAP/studies/36361">National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 2014</a>).</p>
<p>Cutting back before pre-alcoholism progresses to alcoholism would be similar to persons with high cholesterol, hypertension, or modestly high BMI making lifestyle changes or taking medication to prevent serious physical illness. Perhaps persons with pre-alcoholism are persons who have progressed from one or two drinks a night (<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/moderate-drinking.htm">the CDC&rsquo;s recommended limits for women and men respectively</a>) to three or four drinks per night. Or maybe they only drink one night per week but tend to binge&mdash;drinking seven or eight drinks at a time instead of the CDC&rsquo;s recommended limit of 3 drinks for women or 4 drinks for men. Both types of heavy drinking habit are unhealthy and could become unhealthier with the development of tolerance.</p>
<p>So why not just lump these folks under the banner of alcoholism? For a couple reasons. First, the impact we could have on public health by preventing full blown alcoholism is similar to the impact we could have by preventing full blown heart disease or obesity. Prevention and early intervention are always less costly&mdash;personally and financially&mdash;than the treatment of a severe illness. Second, we are getting more and more evidence that chronic heavy drinking even in persons without full blown alcoholism is associated with <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/alcohol-use.htm">increased risk for many illnesses</a>, including heart disease, cancer, and dementia.</p>
<p>How does a person moderate their drinking once they show evidence of pre-alcoholism? There is very detailed guidance on the <a href="http://moderation.org/">Moderation Management website</a>&mdash;a group founded in 1994 as an alternative to Alcoholics Anonymous. What I'd like to offer is a more basic, philosophical point. For persons who are not sure whether they have pre-alcoholism or alcoholism, the question is not whether you need principles to guide your alcohol use; the question is whether the only effective principle would be abstinence. Half-hearted or unprincipled attempts to change a habit are nearly always destined to fail.</p>
<p>A principle is something I commit to before I consider any of the fluctuating particulars of my life. If I'm committed to abstinence, I don't say: I won't drink unless it's a special occasion or unless it&rsquo;s a stressful week at work. I act on principle in the face of the ever-changing landscape of my life. A good friend of mine is 8 years sober and reminds himself every morning before his &ldquo;feet hit the floor&rdquo; that no matter what happens that day--whether he experiences a personal loss, a stressful event, or just the general annoyances and celebrations of life--there will be nothing that is worth using over.</p>
<p>Principles do not survive on will-power alone. If I am committed to abstinence, I do a hundred or &nbsp;thousand things to prevent myself drinking alcohol. I don&rsquo;t keep alcohol in the house, I don&rsquo;t spend time in bars, I call my sponsor every day, I make sure that I get good rest, I process my anxiety or anger, I engage in fun sober activities. Over time, these things become normal parts of my life and don't take much effort; but the principle continues to guide and shape my everyday choices.</p>
<p>Moderation is a more ambiguous principle. And to make it effective, a person needs to do four things: 1) define it clearly; 2) commit to behaviors that support it; 3) stick it out long enough to develop a new habit; 4) maintain the change.</p>
<p>The person who drinks 3 to 4 drinks per night might commit to the principle of abstaining from alcohol during the week. Now, if he drinks three to four drinks on Friday and Saturday, he has decreased his alcohol use by 70% and is within the CDC&rsquo;s recommended limits for men. The binge drinker might commit to drinking no more than 3 drinks on any occasion. Now she has eliminated binge drinking and the acute and chronic effects that often accompany it.</p>
<p>To adhere to these principles, each type of drinker will have to make changes to his or her routine. The daily drinker might want an accountability partner. He may not want to keep alcohol in the house in order to decrease the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/magazine/do-you-suffer-from-decision-fatigue.html?_r=0">decision fatigue</a> that comes with easy access. The person who typically binges may want to alternate alcoholic drinks with non-alcoholic drinks to slow down her drinking; she may want commit to going home at a certain time on the weekend or not hanging out with certain friends with whom she&rsquo;s more likely to binge. She too might benefit from an accountability partner. Both types of heavy drinker might benefit from a period of full sobriety (e.g. one month) before implementing principles of moderation. That period of sobriety helps break the original habit before introducing a new habit and is strongly encouraged by the <a href="http://moderation.org/">Moderation Management</a> program.</p>
<p>A heavy drinker who is moderating their drinking should feel like they are breaking a bad habit. If the attempt doesn&rsquo;t feel like dieting or exercise, it&rsquo;s probably not an honest attempt. Once a new behavioral principle is adhered to for a significant period of time, human beings habituate. The person who drank alcohol daily but now abstains during the week may eventually stop thinking about alcohol during the week. The person who binged on the weekends but now drinks moderately may eventually get accustomed to that change and have a decreased urge to over-drink.</p>
<p>The founder of Moderation Management, Audrey Kishline, eventually wrote an open letter to her supporters explaining that she had come to realize that she suffered from full blown alcoholism and that only abstinence could help her break her addiction. While she attempted to achieve lasting sobriety in AA, she killed a man and his son in a drunk driving accident. She spent some time in prison and never fully recovered from alcoholism.</p>
<p>Ms. Kishline's story is a cautionary tale, but it is not definitive. There is no doubt that the fantasy of every person with alcoholism is to moderate their drinking and that overcoming that fantasy is crucial for achieving long-term sobriety. The writers of the Big Book recall their attempts at controlled drinking: "Here are some of the methods we have tried: Drinking beer only, limiting the number of drinks, never drinking alone, never drinking in the morning, drinking only at home, never having it in the house, never drinking during business hours, drinking only at parties, switching from scotch to brandy, drinking only natural wines..." They jokingly prescribe controlled drinking to their reader: "Step over to the nearest barroom and try some controlled drinking. Try to drink and stop abruptly. Try it more than once. It will not take long for you to decide, if you are honest with yourself about it. It may be worth a bad case of jitters if you get a full knowledge of your condition."</p>
<p>But the writers of the Big Book were writing for persons with severe alcoholism--persons who might wake up with the "jitters"--not people who realize that they've developed an unhealthy drinking habit. If you want to know which camp you fall into, try an honest, principled attempt at moderation. If you're successful, you will be healthier over the long term. If not, you may develop increased awareness of the need to commit to an alcohol-free way of life.</p>
