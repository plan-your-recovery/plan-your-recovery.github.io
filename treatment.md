### Welcome

Persons with addiction are often confused by their inability to stop using alcohol or drugs or to stop engaging in an addictive behavior like gambling. When their cravings are low, it feels like they might be able to stop on their own or moderate their use. Inevitably, the addictive cycle repeats itself causing frustration and shame. Family members and friends become increasingly frustrated and saddened by the changes they witness in their loved one. Sometimes it seems like the person suffering from addiction has lost sight of his or her most important priorities. The good news is that, while addiction can cause drastic changes in a person's behavior and relationships, the changes it causes are not permanent. As a person heals from addiction, his or her true self returns. At _Plan Your Recovery_, we are committed to helping patients and families recover from addiction using a thoughtful, evidence-based, compassionate approach.
