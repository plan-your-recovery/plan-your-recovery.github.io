**Pricing**

Plan Your Recovery does not require a big down payment to get started in treatment. Patients pay only for the services they use. The following are the fees for service:

* Individual or Family Therapy ($90-$150 depending on provider) 
* Group Therapy ($50/group) 
* Recovery Coaching (discuss plans with provider) 
* Urine Drug Screens ($15/screen) 
* Suboxone Treatment ($200 / physician visit through CB Programs)
* Outpatient Alcohol Detoxification ($200 / physician visit through CB Programs) 
* Psychiatry (varies by provider)


**Insurance** 

Plan Your Recovery does not contract with insurance companies for direct payment, but we will submit your group, individual, and family therapy sessions to insurance as a courtesy. Reimbursement will depend on your out-of-network benefits and your insurer's service requirements. Reimbursement is not guaranteed.
